abstract: Abstract Mathematically representing the shape of an object is a key ingredient
  for solving inverse rendering problems. Explicit representations like meshes are
  efficient to render in a differentiable fashion but have difficulties handling topology
  changes. Implicit representations like signed‐distance functions, on the other hand,
  offer better support of topology changes but are much more difficult to use for
  physics‐based differentiable rendering. We introduce a new physics‐based inverse
  rendering pipeline that uses both implicit and explicit representations. Our technique
  enjoys the benefit of both representations by supporting both topology changes and
  differentiable rendering of complex effects such as environmental illumination,
  soft shadows, and interreflection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique
  using several synthetic and real examples.
