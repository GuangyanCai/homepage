abstract: 'Reconstructing the shape and spatially varying surface appearances of a
  physical-world object as well as its surrounding illumination based on 2D images
  (e.g., photographs) of the object has been a long-standing problem in computer vision
  and graphics. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and highly efficient object
  reconstruction pipeline combining neural based object reconstruction and physics-based
  inverse rendering (PBIR). Our pipeline firstly leverages a neural SDF based shape
  reconstruction to produce high-quality but potentially imperfect object shape. Then,
  we introduce a neural material and lighting distillation stage to achieve high-quality
  predictions for material and illumination. In the last stage, initialized by the
  neural predictions, we perform PBIR to refine the initial results and obtain the
  final high-quality reconstruction of object shape, material, and illumination. Experimental
  results demonstrate our pipeline significantly outperforms existing methods quality-wise
  and performance-wise. Code: https://neural-pbir.github.io/'
