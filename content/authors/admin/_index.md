#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Guangyan Cai (蔡广彦), a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine School of Information and Computer Science. My research, conducted under the guidance of [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/), focuses on physics-based differentiable rendering and its applications, with a particular emphasis on inverse rendering.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~ravir/).
